[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Set up a local mock server (optional))]

>**Note:** If you have access to an `SAP S/4HANA Cloud` system with a technical user, you can skip this part.

In order to make a call to an `OData` service, there needs to be a service to call. You can setup a local mock server that mimics the business partner and a custom service by following the instructions [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-s4-sdk-book/pages/mock-odata.html). This mock server does not support all the features of the actual `OData` services, but it suffices to try it out locally.

Once it is up and running you should see the list of services at `http://localhost:3000/`.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Add a custom route)]

Initially, the app only contains the `index` and `hello-world` routes. 
In `Express.js`, routes are functions that handle HTTP requests for a given verb and a given path.
You can also think of routes as API endpoints.

We will add another route for `business-parters` that will retrieve a list of business partners from the SAP S/4HANA system.
First, create a new file `business-partner-route.ts` in the `src/` directory and add an implementation for this route, like so:

```JavaScript / TypeScript
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

export function businessPartners(req: Request, res: Response) {
  res.status(200).send('We will implement this in a minute');
}
```

The `businessPartners` function is a callback function that we will register for a specific route. It writes the status `200` and a placeholder message to the response.

Then, add this route to the routes of your application in `application.ts`:

```JavaScript / TypeScript
private routes(): void {
  const router = express.Router();

  router.get("/", indexRoute);
  router.get("/hello", helloWorld);
  // add this line
  router.get("/business-partners", businessPartners);
  this.app.use("/", router);
}
```

Should your editor not offer you to automatically add the correct import, add the following line to your import statements:

```JavaScript / TypeScript
import { businessPartners } from './business-partner-route';
```

You can start your application by running `npm run start:local`. Now, calling `http://localhost:8080/business-partners` should return our placeholder string.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Import service entities)]

In order to use the `SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript` to make a call to an `OData` service, add the "virtual data model" (VDM) for this service to your dependencies. 
For this tutorial we are using the OData VDM for the business partner service. Install it with the following:

```Shell
npm install @sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service
```

Import the entity you want to retrieve in your application.
In this tutorial we are importing the business partner entity of the business partner service. Add the following line to the top of the `business-partner-route.ts`.

```JavaScript / TypeScript
import { BusinessPartner } from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';
```

Now the `BusinessPartner` entity is available for you to be used.

>**Side-note:** The `SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript` offers packages for each `OData` service exposed by `SAP S/4HANA Cloud`. 
You can find a list of these services in the [`SAP API Business Hub`](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPS4HANACloud?section=Artifacts) and a list of the corresponding packages in our [documentation](https://help.sap.com/doc/9dbcab0600b346c2b359a8c8978a45ba/1.0/en-US/globals.html).

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Execute an OData request)]

In the `business-partner-route` create a function `getAllBusinessPartners` and implement it as follows:

```JavaScript / TypeScript
function getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  return BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
    .getAll()
    .execute({
      url: 'http://localhost:3000'
    });
}
```

- In line 1, we are creating a request builder for the business partner entity.
- Line 2 indicates, that we want to create a request to get all the business partners.
- Line 3 ff. takes care of the execution and sends a request to a `url` based on the given destination `url`.

In the code snippet above we assume that you have a mock server running locally. If you are using an actual `SAP S/4HANA Cloud` system, you can replace the third line with a different destination configuration:

```JavaScript / TypeScript
.execute({
  url: '<URI of your SAP S/4HANA Cloud System>',
  username: '<USERNAME>',
  password: '<PASSWORD>'
})
```

As network requests are asynchronous by nature, the return value of this function is a Promise to a list of Business Partners (`Promise<BusinessPartner[]>`).

Let's add the execution of this request to the callback for our `business-partners` route by making the callback **`async`** and writing the resolved return value of the `getAllBusinessPartners` function to the response:

```JavaScript / TypeScript
export async function businessPartners(req: Request, res: Response) {
  res.status(200).send(await getAllBusinessPartners());
}
```
Here is what your `business-partner-route.ts` should look like, if you are using the mock server:

```JavaScript / TypeScript
import { BusinessPartner } from "@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service";
import { Request, Response } from "express";

export async function businessPartners(req: Request, res: Response) {
  getAllBusinessPartners()
    .then(businessPartners => {
      res.status(200).send(businessPartners);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      res.status(500).send(error.message);
    })
}

function getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  return BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
    .getAll()
    .execute({
      url: 'http://localhost:3000'
    });
}
```

Now restart your server and reload the `http://localhost:8080/business-partners` page to retrieve a list of business partners.

Congratulations, you just made your first call with the SAP Cloud SDK!

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Manage destinations centrally (optional))]

In order to not repeat your destination configuration for every request execution, you can set a `destinations` environment variable to manage your destinations. If you prefer, you can set system wide environment variables. However, we will show you how to set them non-invasively for one project only.

We will use the `dotenv` npm module to facilitate setting environment variables on a node process.
```Shell
# install dotenv as a devDependency
npm install --save-dev dotenv
```
Then create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and define your a `destinations` environment variable as follows:

```
destinations=[{"name": "<DESTINATIONNAME>", "url": "<URL to your system>", "username": "<USERNAME>", "password": "<PASSWORD>"}]
```

This is what it would look like for the mock server:

```
destinations=[{"name": "MockServer", "url": "http://localhost:3000"}]
```

Now to reference a destination in the request execution, simply replace the `url` with a `destinationName` - `MockServer` in our example:

```JavaScript / TypeScript
function getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  return BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
    .getAll()
    .execute({
      destinationName: 'MockServer'
    });
}
```
Note, that every environment variable in the `.env` file has to be defined *on one line*. You can add more destinations to the array.

In order to register the `.env` file in your node process, adjust the `"start:local"` script in the `package.json` as follows:

```Shell
"start:local": "npx ts-node -r dotenv/config src/"
```
Now, when you execute `npm run start:local` and call `localhost:8080/business-partners`, you can also use your remote destination locally.
